2. **Zooming In and Out:**
   You can zoom in or out on the page to enlarge or shrink the clockâ€™s size using the following methods:
   - **Browser Zoom**: Use `Ctrl` + `+` to zoom in and `Ctrl` + `-` to zoom out on most browsers. Alternatively, use `Cmd` + `+` / `Cmd` + `-` for Mac users.
   - **Mouse Scroll**: Hold the `Ctrl` key (or `Cmd` on Mac) and scroll your mouse wheel up to zoom in or down to zoom out.
   
   This will resize the clock hands and the clock container itself, providing flexibility in how you view the clock.

3. **Clock Hands Movement:**
   - The hour, minute, and second hands rotate in real-time, updating every second.
   - The minute and second hands move in precise increments as per the current time, and the hour hand gradually moves as time progresses.
